                            <p class="card-text">This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored
                            across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session
                            ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage
                            data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session)</p>
                            <p class="card-text">If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system instead of being loaded
                            from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may vary among different browsers. Each file appears to
                            be returned a different object by localStorage in all current browsers: URL. Essentially, it seems to be a case of each
                            URL: file having its own unique local storage area.
                            
                            This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain unclear. As such,
                            there’s a possibility that browsers may change how they handle files at any time. The way some browsers handle it has
                            evolved.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between
                            sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when
                            the page session ends.
                            
                            A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab
                            at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after
                            the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from
                            session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a
                            tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and
                            clears sessionStorage objects.</p>
